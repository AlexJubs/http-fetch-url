# http-fetch-url

I orginally wrote this for a coding assessment, but I found it pretty useful so I decided to modify a few things :)

This CLI tool takes an argument that is a full URL (--url). The tool will make an HTTP request to the URL and print the response directly to the console.

I use this to measure how fast I can perform http on different hosts. I choose C as it is a perfect systems programming language, very well optimized as a performant programming tool.
